    excerpt: "Renting a bike can be a breeze if you know what to look for. Here are our top 5 tips to ensure you have the best experience.",

      <p>Renting a bike is one of the most convenient ways to explore a new city or commute without the hassle of ownership. However, for first-timers, it can feel a bit overwhelming. Here are our top tips to make your next rental seamless.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Check the Vehicle Thoroughly</h3>
      <p>Before you ride off, take a few minutes to inspect the bike. Check the tires, brakes, and lights. If you notice any existing scratches or issues, make sure to document them or inform the rental provider.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Understand the Pricing</h3>
      <p>Different providers have different pricing models—hourly, daily, or weekly. At RideFlow, we offer flexible plans starting at just ₹10/hour. Make sure you understand the fuel policy and any late return charges.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Carry Your Documents</h3>
      <p>Always have a valid driving license and a government-issued ID proof handy. Most digital platforms, including RideFlow, allow you to upload these for quick verification.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Safety First</h3>
      <p>Never compromise on safety. Always wear a helmet. We provide a complimentary helmet with every booking to ensure you're protected on the road.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Plan Your Route</h3>
      <p>While exploring is fun, having a rough idea of your destination and parking spots can save you a lot of time and battery/fuel.</p>

    title: "Why Electric Bikes are the Future of Urban Commuting",
    excerpt: "Discover how electric bikes are changing the way we move through cities, from reducing carbon footprints to saving on fuel costs.",
    content: `
      <p>Urban mobility is undergoing a massive transformation, and electric bikes (E-bikes) are leading the charge. Here's why you should consider an E-bike for your next city ride.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Eco-Friendly Transportation</h3>
      <p>E-bikes produce zero emissions, making them a sustainable alternative to petrol-powered vehicles. By choosing an electric rental, you're contributing to a cleaner, greener city.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Cost-Effective</h3>
      <p>With rising fuel prices, electric bikes are incredibly easy on the pocket. The cost per kilometer is a fraction of what you'd spend on a traditional motorcycle.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Beat the Traffic</h3>
      <p>The compact design of E-bikes allows you to navigate through congested city streets much faster than a car. Plus, finding parking is never an issue!</p>
      
      <h3>4. No License Required for Some Models</h3>
      <p>Many low-speed electric scooters don't even require a formal driving license, making them accessible to a wider range of riders.</p>
      
      <p>At RideFlow, we're expanding our fleet of electric bikes to provide you with the most modern and sustainable rental options available.</p>
